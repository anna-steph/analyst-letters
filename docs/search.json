    "text": "#pipelinematters\n#viewsmyown\n\n\nIn an ideal world, your work is your training.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate this.\n\nYou don’t need additional training if your work pushes you to improve in the direction you’re seeking.\nIf your work contributes to your development, you have a better sense of what any additional training should target.\n\nThis is much easier said than done. It’s honestly tough to find work utilizing the exact skills you hope to build. If you’re in such a role, congratulations! You’ve won the growth lottery.\n\nTime use at work\nWhen thinking about your development, understand how you’re using time at work and how it contributes to your growth.\nEveryone has three classes of work:\n\nClass A: CV-worthy accomplishments. Highlights you’re legitimately proud of, that you brag to your friends about, that you’d describe in a job interview.\nClass B: What’s on the tin. The main focus of your daily work. Ideally this still helps you grow, but it’s more routine.\nClass C: Other tasks, potentially extraneous, that you don’t prioritize but become part of your responsibilities.\n\nYou can roughly track how you spend your time. How is your time divided among these three classes of work?\nWhere possible, try to focus your time on Class A and B work.\n\nIf that’s happening, tell your manager how happy you are with this scope of work! Your manager needs to hear this; it shows your appreciation.\n\nIf that’s not happening, can you discuss the work you’d prefer with your manager? If you’ve gently raised this question a few times and the response left you discouraged, it’s a sign you may need to consider alternatives.\n\nIt’s okay—even good—if the skills you want to develop change over time. You can adjust Class A/B/C work classes to reflect your new priorities.\n\n\nHow to train when your work is not your training\nCommiserations! Most folks you know have been here at some point in their careers. It’s demoralizing, so hang in there.\nAt work:\n\nSolicit other work from those around you.\n\nAsk for side projects or short-term stretch projects—if possible, even if they take time outside work.\n\nOutside work:\n\nJoin a professional association, meet-up group, or other forum. Be active in this group. Use it to cross-train, network, and seek advice.\n\nIf possible, do external work, either paid or unpaid. Anything that gets you credible, demonstrable experience using skills you want to develop.\n\n\n\nAsk for and actively incorporate feedback\nGetting quick, practicable, constructive feedback on short-term assignments is essential to growth. It can come from anywhere.\n\nConstantly solicit feedback and thank the people who give you feedback.\n\nBe teachable. If you trust and respect the feedback-giver, remember what they’ve told you to change and adjust as necessary. Actively demonstrate your capacity to learn.\n\nReverse feedback: If you see someone around you who excels in an area you hope to improve, tell them so! Ask if you can interview them about it. Can you learn from what they do well?\n\n\n\nBenchmarking exercises\nEvery 2-4 years (or some other suitable interval), plan to:\n\nApply for positions that represent next steps you’d be interested in.\n\nCollect these positions’ required skills and accomplishments and assess where you have gaps. These gaps can be used for training.\n\nInterview for them! Where possible, interview to assess your own ability as well as for practice. You’ll interview over the course of your career, so practice matters.\n\nBenchmarking is highly credible feedback on our growth and abilities. It also reminds us that what we do is a choice. Choice in what we do is one of the most valuable gifts we can give ourselves. It gives us agency.\nBest of luck!",

    "text": "#pipelinematters\n#viewsmyown\n\n\nFirst, congrats on the interview!\nLanding an interview is a big step.\nThe organization is seriously considering you as a candidate and wants to learn more about you and your experience. If we assume most entry-level positions receive 200+ applications, reaching the interview stage is already a noteworthy milestone.\nNow:\n\n\n\nDo your research.\nTry to find out the org’s interview structure, questions, technical elements. This is the time to let your internet sleuthing research chops shine. Find out:\n\nHow many rounds are there in the process? Are they with the team, the manager, HR?\nAre interviews structured as group or individual interviews?\nAre there any technical exams? Exams are sometimes used as an initial screen.\nAre there any assignments, case interviews, technical interviews? These may require significant preparation and familiarity to pass. Potential formats:\n\nTake-home: The recruiter asks you to pick a date. Once set, they send you an assignment similar to their work, and you have [X] hours to complete and return it.\nTechnical interviews: As part of an interview process, the hiring manager either requests you walk through a technical problem live or gives you [X] hours to walk through it on your own, then send or present your analysis to the team.\nCase interviews: Typically used in management consulting, these interviews walk through a prospective client interaction designed to test your demeanor and problem-solving/quantitative abilities. If you’re applying for an entry-level role, you may need a couple months to prepare.\n\n\nSources of information:\n\nAsk/email recruiters about the recruitment process and interview structure.\nTalk to current and former employees to understand their experience.\nLook on the company’s LinkedIn page.\nLook on Glassdoor, likely the most useful online resource for interview questions. Other Q&A boards like Reddit or Quora could also be helpful.*\n\n* As with all information online, take what you find with a grain of salt. Try to confirm through an org contact.\n\n\n\nPractice.\n\nIn interviewing, (nearly) all practice is good practice.\n\nInterviewing is like any other skill: you get better with practice. You’ll interview over the course of your professional life. The time you invest in improving will come in handy down the line.\nOnce you have a list of practice interview questions (see below), practice, practice, practice.\nWrite and speak your responses out loud. Ask your friends, classmates, or family if they’d be willing to conduct a mock interview.\nYour responses should:\n- be focused, two minutes tops. Don’t ramble.\n- be tailored to the org, which shows your prep.\n- address their needs for the role. Does the job description say detail-oriented? Give examples showing you’re detail-oriented.\n- help you put your best foot forward: prepare to show, not tell, specific examples from your experience to highlight.\n\n\n\nBriefcase test.\nAs much as possible, show off actual work product: papers, projects, or code repos.\n\nIf you’re a student or recent grad, come prepared with hard copies of one or two papers, printed in color, ideally with calculations or code. The more relevant, the better.\n\nIn particular:\n\nWork vetted through a formal publication process.\nWork published online by an org you can link to.\nPapers you’ve received positive feedback on.\nOnline portfolios they can review.\nCode you’ve posted online, even for a personal or volunteer project.*\n\n\n* Before posting code online: If you wrote the code for a specific org, find out their policies on making it publicly available. Some places are happy to have you post; others consider it a legal matter, a security risk, or the org’s proprietary IP.\n\n\n\nQuestions they might ask you\n\n“Tell me about yourself and why you applied for this position.”\n\n\nNearly 100% chance you’ll be asked this question, so practice answering it.\nTime your answer to this question. It shouldn’t exceed 2 minutes, which shows your focus and preparation.\n\n\n“Tell me a time when…”\n\n\nThese are great questions. They’re designed to understand how you approach your work, what role you play on a team, how you collaborate with others, how you resolve disagreements, how you demonstrate leadership, how you deal with challenges, whether you can teach yourself new skills, whether you’re “teachable” and can take needed guidance/course-correction.\n\nThink of a few lessons from each of your prior experiences. You can pull from part-time jobs, internships, or group projects if you haven’t had a full-time job yet. Write out what you learned from each. How have you put your learning into practice? How did you grow from those experiences?\n\nDon’t speak in hypotheticals. Give concrete examples.\n\nPay attention to what’s asked: their questions often describe the dynamics and challenges of the current team.\n\n\n“Explain [a technical process you’ll use] in plain English.”\n\n\nA lot of technical or specialized work interfaces with nontechnical roles or roles that don’t share the same expertise, whether across a team, an org, or between an org and its clients. Communication is key to that work.\nIf you have a technical skillset, interviewers will frequently ask you to explain some part of this work “in plain English,” to a curious but nontechnical audience.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions you might ask them\nInterviewing is a two-way street. Any good org should save at least five minutes for you to ask questions. They’re judging you by your questions; try not to ask anything obvious you can easily Google or find out other ways.\nBe cautious if asking questions they have hard constraints or sensitivities around answering. You’re unlikely to get good information from their responses, so why ask? Find a better source for that information.\nUseful information when considering a potential position:\nYou owe it to yourself to do your own desk research on these questions, but it’s valuable to get the org’s take on:\nThe role:\n\nWhat’s this role like day-to-day? Will you be using skills that actively promote your development? Is the work collaborative or individual? How is analyst performance incentivized?\n\nIMO, titles are less important than work outputs and skills developed through daily use.\n\nWhat does “success” look like in this role? What would you be expected to achieve at one month, six months, one year? What metrics are used? Is any sample work available?\n\nWhat is the manager’s expectations for this role, are they realistic, and do your expectations for the role align with theirs?\n\nDoes this role have a typical trajectory? What have previous analysts gone on to do? What training and development opportunities are available?\n\nKey here are “typical trajectory” and “previous analysts.” “Development opportunities” are good to hear about but may be hypothetical.\n\n\nThe team:\n\nWhat’s the manager like? What do they value in their employees? How do you think you’ll work together?\nWhat’s the team like? Can you get a sense of their dynamic? How is responsibility shared? Does the team share information and resources, or do analysts work in siloes?\n\nTeam intel is key. Easily 60% of your work depends on who you work with.\n\nWhere does the team sit within the org? How is the team viewed by the org? How is the team’s work utilized by other teams and by leadership? How visible is the team’s work to leadership?\n\nThe org:\n\nWhat’s the org like? How does it position itself in its industry? What’s its business model?\n\nCan you draw up a rough SWOT analysis to understand how the org sees itself in relation to its environment? How does its future look?\n\nWithin the org, what skills/traits are valued? What achievements or types of work are rewarded?\n\nIncentives tell you a lot about org culture through “revealed preferences,” i.e., what the org actively rewards.\n\nWhich types of work, positions, teams are seen as “core” or “central” to the business mission, and which are “auxiliary,” nice-to-have but not essential?\n\nOrgs frequently value “auxiliary” roles differently: you may have more “sticks” than “carrots”; your effort may be invisible; your position may also be at-risk when the org cuts staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood luck!",

The lifestyle you ordered is currently out of stock,” London, 2011.\n\n\n\nHuman capital–us, what we’re capable of with our skills and training–is the most precious resource in any economy. It’s hard-won and too easily lost in a grueling labor market. Since 2008 we’ve seen generation-defining spikes of youth unemployment. As we face more waves of labor market uncertainty, I know we can do better.\nWe can do better by the generation of new analysts rising behind us. It’s each generation’s responsibility to throw a rope ladder out to the generation rising after them, to help them up the first rungs. No one does this alone.\nWe can also do better by the age-wizened analysts seeking to level up, folks seeking to learn but too shy or proud to ask where to start. The labor market’s always evolving, a kaleidoscope dance floor we trip to keep pace with, a path of laser fields we navigate haphazardly, learning through our stumbles. Continuing education in most fields is neither easy nor obvious.\nThis blog is for both analysts. For folks starting & re-starting.\nWe can never predict what our lives will look like, and our decisions are always at least half chance, made with whatever imperfect information available to us at the time. Despite this, we can create processes to better understand, track, and further our own development, and we can increase our awareness of the types of work and skill-sets in use around us. Growth is easier as a team sport. It’s a virtuous cycle.\nTo the extent this is helpful to you, pay it forward. The coming generation needs you.\nTo your future development! ✨🥂 ✨",

    "text": "#pipelinematters\n#viewsmyown\n\n\nResearching positions\nWhen considering a specific opening:\n\nWhich skills are necessary to get in the door at Jobt=1? If asked, how might you demonstrate those skills?\n\nDon’t invest too much in job titles. How do people in the position of interest actually spend their time? Are those tasks you’d find valuable and interesting?\n\nIdeally, your work is your training.\n\n\nLook two jobs down the line: what skills, experiences, and accomplishments do you need out of Jobt=1 (2-3 years out) to prepare you for Jobt=2 (5-7 years out)?\n\n\n\nResearching organizations\nWhen beginning a longer, wide-ranging job search, start with a list of at least 20 organizations of interest. You may have a “top ten” list in mind, but push yourself beyond your shortlist.\nFor each organization:\n\nHow does the organization see and talk about itself? How does it position itself within an industry?\n\nWhere does its business come from? How does it finance itself? Who are its “clients” (defined broadly)?\n\nWhat are the trajectories of the people who are there now and were there in the past? What skills and experiences did they have before joining? What skills do they use now?\n\nIn addition to speaking to people there now, can you speak with someone who was there previously?\n\nPrevious employees are able to be more frank, and they can put their experience into a broader perspective.\n\n\n\n\nResearching careers\nIf you feel very uncertain where to begin, it may be useful to first identify jobs you aspire towards, then work backwards to reverse engineer a path. For this, find 20 people doing cool things 5-7 years out from where you are (roughly two jobs out). Those folks will have relevant, current career information, but they can also put their last job into perspective.\nToo far out, and their advice might not be current or applicable to you.\nToo close, and they may not have enough perspective and benefit of hindsight.\n\nConduct informational interviews to specifically ask:\n\nHow did they get such cool positions? What credentials, skills, experiences, and accomplishments were necessary for their role?\n\nWhat skills do they find most valuable or useful in their current work?\n\nWhat do they wish they’d known when they started out?\n\nWho else would they recommend you talk to?\n\nHow to scope these conversations:\n\nTiming: Stick to 20-25 minutes if it’s a phone call. If it’s in person, ask how much time they have and aim to end within 30 minutes. Keep within time.\n\nCome prepared: Do your research on who they are and what they do. Try not to ask anything you can easily Google. This shows respect for their time, and it’s a good use of your time as well.\n\nIn your initial email request:\n\nWhy them: Explain why you admire their work and why you’re asking for their advice:\n\n“given your experience/expertise in [Subject]”.\n\n“admire the work you’ve done on [Subject]”.\n\nYour reasons for contacting them should be completely genuine and specific to them/their experience.\nOtherwise, why bother? Don’t waste your or their time.\n\n\nPreview: Send 4-5 broad questions you want to walk through. Always end with “Who else would you recommend I speak with?”\n\nIdeally, every conversation sparks another conversation.\n\nYou might be surprised by how open people—including folks you don’t know—are to chatting with you if they know which specific questions you’d find helpful.\n\n\nIntros: If someone pointed you to that person, say so: “I was recommended to reach out to you by [Person],” “[Person] recommended contacting you given your expertise on [Subject].”\n\nThe ideal is to be introduced by someone else. Barring an introduction, if someone recommended you reach out, start by saying that.\n\n\nBest of luck!",
