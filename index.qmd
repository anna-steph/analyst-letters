## To the Young and Young at Heart {#welcome}

This blog began as a phone call, then got sent as an email, followed by a second email.\
As of now, it's a collection of career frameworks I've shared often enough to build a home for them.\
The advice, to the extent it's valuable, is usually a product of [me] learning the hard way. 

As with all advice, your mileage may vary. Take it with a grain of salt. 

## Why "Letters"? {#whyletters}

Human capital--us, what we're capable of with our skills and training--is the most precious resource
in any economy. It's hard-won and too easily lost in a grueling labor market. Since 2008 we've seen generation-defining
spikes of [youth unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14024887).
As we face more waves of labor market uncertainty, I know we can do better.

We can do better by the generation of new analysts rising behind us. It's each generation's responsibility to throw a rope ladder out to the generation rising after them, to help them up the first rungs. No one does this alone. 

We can also do better by the age-wizened analysts seeking to level up, folks seeking to learn but too shy or proud to ask where to start. The labor market's always evolving, a kaleidoscope dance floor we trip to keep pace with,
a path of laser fields we navigate haphazardly, learning through our stumbles. Continuing education in most fields is neither easy nor obvious.

This blog is for both analysts. For folks starting & re-starting.

We can never predict what our lives will look like, and our decisions are always at least half
chance, made with whatever imperfect information available to us at the time. Despite this,
we can create processes to better understand, track, and further our own development, and we can 
increase our awareness of the types of work and skill-sets in use around us. Growth is easier as a team sport. It's a virtuous cycle.

To the extent this is helpful to you, pay it forward. The coming generation needs you.

To your future development! ✨🥂 ✨
