Another career analyst framework, hopefully general enough to be broadly useful.
Sharing if also helpful to you. Aimed at early career and new grads without
extensive prior experience.

### First, congrats on the interview! 

Landing an interview is a big step. If we assume most entry-level positions receive
200+ applications, you've already achieved a noteworthy milestone. The organization is 
seriously considering you as a candidate and wants to learn more about you and your experience. 

Now:

### Do your research.

Try to find out the org's interview structure, questions, technical elements. This is the
time to let your ~~internet sleuthing~~ research chops shine. For this,

Find out:  

- How many rounds are there in the process?
- Are there set questions?
- Are interviews structured as group or individual interviews?
- Are there any technical exams? Exams are sometimes used as an initial screen.
- Are there any assignments, case interviews, technical interviews? These may require
significant preparation and familiarity to pass. Potential formats:
  1. Take-home: The recruiter asks you to pick a date. Once set, they send you an assignment
  similar to their work, and you have [X] hours to complete and return it.
  2. Technical interviews: As part of an interview process, the hiring 
  manager either requests you walk through a technical problem live or gives you [X]
  hours to walk through it on your own, then send or present your analysis.
  to complete it and walk through your work with them/their team.
  3. Case interviews: Typical in management consulting, these interviews walk 
  through a prospective client interaction designed to test your demeanor and
  problem-solving/quantitative abilities. If you're an entry-level candidate,
  you may need a couple months to prepare. 

Sources of information:

- Ask the recruiter about the recruitment process and interview structure.
- Talk to current and former employees to understand their experience.
- Look on the company's [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) page.
- Look on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm), likely the most useful
online resource for interview questions. Other Q&A boards like 
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) or [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) could also be helpful.*

\* As with all information online, take what you find with a grain of salt. Try to confirm
through an org contact.

### Practice.

> In interviewing, (nearly) all practice is good practice.  

Interviewing is like any other skill: you get better with practice. You'll interview
over the course of your professional life. Any time you invest in improving
will come in handy down the line.  

Once you have a list of practice interview questions (see below), practice, practice, practice.  
Write and speak your answers aloud. Ask your friends, classmates, or family if they'd be 
willing to conduct a mock interview. 

Your answers should:  
- be **focused, two minutes tops.** Don't ramble.   
- be **tailored to the org,** which shows your prep.  
- **address their needs** for the role. Does the job description say detail-oriented?
Show how you're detail-oriented.  
- **help you put your best foot forward:** demonstrated knowledge and experience, 
critical thinking, times when you've shown good judgment or leadership ability. 

---

### Briefcase test.

As much as possible, show off **actual** proof-of-work: papers, projects, or code repos. 

- If you're a student or recent grad, come prepared with hard copies of one or two
papers, printed in color, ideally with calculations or code. The more relevant, the better.  
- In particular:
  - Work that's been through a formal publication process.
  - Work published online by an org you can link to.
  - Papers you've received good feedback on.
  - Online portfolios they can review.
  - Code you've posted online, even for a personal or volunteer project.*
  
\* *Before posting code online:* If you wrote the code for a specific org, find out
their policies on making it publicly available. Some places are happy to have you
post; others consider it a legal matter, a security risk, or the org's proprietary IP.

---

### Questions they might ask you:

>"Tell me about yourself and why you applied for this position."  

- Nearly *100%* chance you'll be asked this question, so practice answering it.
- *Time your answer* to this question. It shouldn't exceed 2 minutes,
which shows your focus and preparation.  

>"Tell me a time when... "  

- These are great questions. They're designed to understand how you approach your work,
what role you play on a team, how you collaborate with others, how you resolve 
disagreements, how you demonstrate leadership, how you deal with challenges,
whether you can teach yourself new skills, whether you're "teachable" and can
take needed criticism/guidance/course-correction.  
- Think of a few lessons from each of your prior experiences. You can pull from
part-time jobs, internships, or group projects if you haven't had a full-time job yet.
Write out what you learned from each. How have you put your learning into practice? 
How did you grow from those experiences?  
- *Don't* speak in hypotheticals. Give concrete examples.  
- Pay attention to what's asked: their questions often describe the dynamics and 
challenges of the current team.  

>"Explain [a technical process you'll use] in plain English."

### Questions you might ask them:

Interviewing is a two-way street. Any good org should save at least five minutes
for you to ask questions. They're judging you; try not to ask anything
obvious you can easily Google or find out other ways. IMO, also be very cautious in asking
questions they have hard constraints or sensitivities around answering.

Standard questions to ask them:  

The role:

- What's the typical "day" in this job? What does the day-to-day look like? What skills
does it use and develop over time?  
- What does "success" look like in this role? What would you be expected to achieve at
one month, six months, one year?
  - You need to know how you'll be evaluated, what your metrics are, and
  any milestones they expect you to meet in the first X months.
- What does the mix of collaborative vs. individual work look like?

The org: 

- Where does the org's "business" come from? How is it funded? Who are its clients and
how do they use the org's work? What's the "mix" of business in each client type?  
- Is there cyclicality or "busy periods"/"slow periods" in this work?  


Keep an eye out for red flags. Jacqueline Nolis and Emily Robinson created
a [great list]() of a few to watch out for. To this, I'd add:
